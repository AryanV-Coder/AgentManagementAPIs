# CI/CD Deprecation Fix - Applied ✅

## Issue Fixed
Your CI/CD pipeline was failing due to deprecated GitHub Actions versions:
- `actions/upload-artifact: v3` → **deprecated**
- `actions/download-artifact: v3` → **deprecated** 
- `actions/setup-python: v4` → **outdated**

## Changes Applied

### ✅ Updated GitHub Actions to Latest Versions:
- `actions/upload-artifact@v3` → `actions/upload-artifact@v4`
- `actions/download-artifact@v3` → `actions/download-artifact@v4` 
- `actions/setup-python@v4` → `actions/setup-python@v5`
- `actions/checkout@v4` → **kept** (already latest)

### ✅ Updated Locations:
1. **Upload OpenAPI Schema** (line ~65)
2. **Download OpenAPI Schema** (line ~108) 
3. **Upload Keploy Test Reports** (line ~128)
4. **Setup Python** (both jobs - lines ~28 and ~89)

## Verification
```bash
# Check for deprecated actions
grep -c "@v3" .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml
# Result: 0 (no deprecated actions found)

# View all GitHub Actions versions
grep "actions/" .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml
# All now use v4 or v5
```

## Status: ✅ Ready to Push
Your CI/CD pipeline should now work without deprecation errors. The next time you push to GitHub, the workflow should execute successfully (assuming Keploy command is configured).

## Next Steps:
1. **Push changes** to GitHub
2. **Set up Keploy** (follow setup_keploy.sh)
3. **Add KEPLOY_API_KEY** to GitHub secrets
4. **Update workflow** with your Keploy command
5. **Monitor pipeline** execution
